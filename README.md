##README



Note that I scripted this in 8 hours, so If i remember correctly, the loop after the initial greeting is not present. But if you would be so kind to add one, that would be great. I have no further intention on working on this project anyway. Do what you want with it, but just give credit where due. 

Possibilities:
Add more commands
Make OPENAI recognize what you are saying instead of looking for a keyword
^use def consultai for everything
Translate to C/C++ for faster response times
